## What is this?
This is the code I have written to load with my emacs sessions and
conform the environment to be the editor I want it to be.

## How is it used?
If you want to give it a whirl, download and place the
root of this folder as your ~/.emacs.d. Begin a new emacs session and
see if it's what you're looking for. I didn't create this with you in
mind.

## TODO
- travis-ci
