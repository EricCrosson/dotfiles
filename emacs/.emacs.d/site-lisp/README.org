This is the =load-path= for esc's GNU Emacs system.

Anything that needs to be sourced can be found if it lies below this
path. Lisp is in the lisp dir, haskell in the haskell dir. [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][Elpa]]
contains the wonderful community packages I've grown used to, which
are included in this repo to reduce bootstrap time on new hosts.

This is where the nectar lies.
