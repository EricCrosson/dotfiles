;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 24 introduced lexical scope for variables to Emacs
;; Lisp.  However, rather than provide it via a new form, say llet or
;; whatever, the buffer local variable `lexical-binding' was
;; introduced to switch the behaviour of binding forms.  This is an
;; unfortunate situation because the semantics of a piece of code
;; depend on the value of a buffer local variable at the time of
;; evaluation.

;; This minor mode is intended to make it plain what the value of
;; `lexical-binding' is in the buffers used to evaluate Lisp forms.
;; It does this by adding to the mode line the string "(LEX)" to
;; indicate lexical binding is enabled, and "(DYN)" to indicate that
;; lexical binding is disabled and that dynamic binding is in effect.

;; Other lexical scope specific utilities such as lexbind-lexscratch
;; may also find a home here.

;; To install, once lexbind-mode.el is located somewhere in your
;; load-path, you can add this to your initialization file:

;; (require 'lexbind-mode)
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lexbind-mode)
