;;; Commentary:

;; Provides an auto-complete source for Haskell which obtains its
;; completions from the current inferior haskell process (see the
;; `haskell-process' library included in `haskell-mode').

;;; Installation:

;; Available as a package in MELPA at http://melpa.org/
;; M-x package-install ac-haskell-process

;;; Usage:

;;     (require 'ac-haskell-process) ; if not installed via package.el
;;     (add-hook 'interactive-haskell-mode-hook 'ac-haskell-process-setup)
;;     (add-hook 'haskell-interactive-mode-hook 'ac-haskell-process-setup)
;;     (eval-after-load "auto-complete"
;;       '(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'haskell-interactive-mode))

;; If you want to trigger auto-complete using TAB in REPL buffers, you may
;; want to use auto-complete in your `completion-at-point-functions':

;;     (defun set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function ()
;;       (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions 'auto-complete))
;;     (add-hook 'auto-complete-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
;;     (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'haskell-interactive-mode)
;;     (add-hook 'haskell-interactive-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
;;     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
;;
;; You can use `ac-haskell-process-popup-doc' to pop up documentation
;; for the symbol at point:
;;
;;     (eval-after-load 'haskell-mode
;;       '(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'ac-haskell-process-popup-doc))
;;
;; This will only work if Emacs can execute the "hoogle" command.
