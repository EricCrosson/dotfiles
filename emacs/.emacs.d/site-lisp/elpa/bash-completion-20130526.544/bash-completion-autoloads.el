(autoload 'bash-completion-setup "bash-completion" "\
Register bash completion for the shell buffer and shell command line.

This function adds `bash-completion-dynamic-complete' to the completion
function list of shell mode, `shell-dynamic-complete-functions' and to the
completion function list of shell-command, `shell-command-complete-functions'.

This function is convenient, but it might not be the best way of enabling
bash completion in your .emacs file because it forces you to load the module
before it is needed. For an autoload version, add:

  (autoload 'bash-completion-dynamic-complete \"bash-completion\"
    \"BASH completion hook\")
  (add-hook 'shell-dynamic-complete-functions
  	  'bash-completion-dynamic-complete)
  (add-hook 'shell-command-complete-functions
  	  'bash-completion-dynamic-complete))

\(fn)" nil nil)

(autoload 'bash-completion-dynamic-complete "bash-completion" "\
Complete word at cursor using BASH completion.

This function is meant to be added into
`shell-dynamic-complete-functions' or
`shell-command-complete-functions'.  It uses `comint' to figure
out what the current command is and calls
`comint-dynamic-simple-complete' to do the completion.

If a match was found, it is displayed as is usual for comint
completion.  Return nil if no match was found.

\(fn)" nil nil)

(autoload 'bash-completion-reset "bash-completion" "\
Force the next completion command to start with a fresh BASH process.

This function kills any existing BASH completion process.  This way, the
next time BASH completion is requested, a new process will be created with
the latest configuration.

Call this method if you have updated your .bashrc or any bash init scripts
and would like bash completion in Emacs to take these changes into account.
