;;; Usage:
;;
;; Bind `org-cliplink` function to something. For example, put
;; this line in your init file:
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x p i") 'org-cliplink)
;;
;; Then copy any http/https URL to the clipboard, switch to
;; the Emacs window and hit `C-x p i`.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A simple command that takes a URL from the clipboard and inserts an
;; org-mode link with a title of a page found by the URL into the
;; current buffer
;;
;; This code was a part of my Emacs config almost a year. I decided to
;; publish it as a separate package in case someone needs this feature
;; too.
