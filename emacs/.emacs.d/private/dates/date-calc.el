;;; Commentary:

;; After several times wishing for the Perl Date::Calc module in
;; elisp, I finally decided to just re-write the code.  I'm not done
;; yet; however, I wanted to get something "published" sooner rather
;; than later.  I'll continue working on this as I can.  It's
;; important to me.  This will serve as a stepping stone to writing an
;; iCalendar/iTIP (rfc 2445, 2446) compliant scheduler.  If you have
;; any problems with the interface to this code, let me know.  I'm
;; certainly willing to be flexible.  What I really want is the
;; functionality.  I'm not too hung up on the actual interface.

    In fact the calendar that was used BEFORE the Gregorian calendar was the Julian calendar - named after famous Julius
    Caesar, who had instituted it in Roman times. The Julian calendar was less precise because it had too many leap years

    the Sabbath or Saturday (where according to the Genesis (as described in the Bible) the Lord rested from creating the

    In medieval times, Catholic Popes have decreed the Sunday to be the official day of rest, in order to dissociate the
    Christian from the Hebrew belief.

    Nowadays, the Sunday AND the Saturday are commonly considered (and used as) days of rest, usually referred to as the
