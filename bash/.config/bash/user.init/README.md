This directory contains scripts to be run only by a specific
machine. See the last line in my .bashrc- if a file exists in this
directory matching the hostname of the current machine, it will be
executed. This is a handy way to keep my main configuration global,
while handling the idiosyncrasies that need to be dealt with.
